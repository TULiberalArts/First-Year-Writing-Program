Students may begin their courses in Spanish and Portuguese at the elemental level where the instruction targets communication skills allowing students to use their second language even after one semester whilst preparing them for the demands of upper level courses. At the low intermediate level, dedicated courses in reading, writing and conversation enhance proficiency as students explore more deeply Hispanic culture. The diversity of courses at the intermediate level allows students to use their language skills to pursue particular interests. Survey courses cover topics such as Spanish or Spanish-American literature, film or culture while professional courses introduce students to relevant cultural practices and vocabulary in sectors such as health care or business. Students majoring in Spanish will polish their written and oral discourse in the writing intensive courses and the advanced level courses. In advanced level courses such as Spanish-English Contrasts, Hispanic Women Writers and Spanish Internship, students delve into their subject producing extended oral and written discourse thus preparing them for graduate study in any discipline and for their future careers.
