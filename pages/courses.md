We offer two courses, English 0701 and English 0802, each of which has equivalent courses for students who have learned English as a Second Language (ESL). These courses provide a year-long sequence of writing instruction. About a quarter of all students take English 0701 and the rest go into English 0802. Placement into your First Year Writing course or courses is determined by [Institutional Research and Assessment](https://atlas.ocis.temple.edu/MarcPlmts/Splash.html). If you have questions about your placement, you may write to [placements@temple.edu](mailto:placements@temple.edu) or call [215-204-8611](tel:2152048611).

## English 0701 and 0711 (the ESL equivalent): Introduction to Academic Discourse
Introduction to Academic Discourse develops the reading skills, writing skills, and self-awareness that students need in order to understand and participate in academic discourse. Academic discourse is the system of institutions, scholars, texts, and arguments that creates, shapes, and perpetuates knowledge in the university. These classes are small (currently 14-18 students in each section), and they focus on deep exploration of texts and ideas through class discussion, they offer direct classroom instruction on rhetoric, grammar, and citation to help students employ academic evidence correctly, and they require a minimum of three one-on-one conferences with the instructor to provide intensive, individualized support. Every section of English 0701 and 0711 has a single theme that is explored from multiple perspectives. Students must complete four major writing assignments that are revised and submitted in an end-of-semester final portfolio, and each assignment goes through a peer review and revision process before the portfolio is complete. Students are also taught to reflect upon their own progress and set meaningful learning goals of their own along the way. Portfolios are reviewed through our Teaching Circle process in which trained instructors agree upon grades for student portfolios every semester.

## English 0802, 0812 (the ESL equivalent), and 0902 (the Honors equivalent): Analytical Reading and Writing 
Analytical Reading and Writing is one of the foundation Gen Ed courses required of all Temple students. It is designed to introduce you to the challenges and pleasures of academic writing, not only for Gen Ed but for your entire academic career. The major learning goals of this class include applying your critical reading and thinking skills in college-level writing assignments, creating and defending original arguments that participate fully and thoughtfully in academic discourse, and reflecting upon the writing process as a whole (including revising, practicing peer review, and evaluating oneâ€™s own work and progress). These classes are small (14-23 students in each section), feature challenging course readings and in-class debate and discussion, provide two research sessions taught by advanced Temple librarians, and require a minimum of two one-on-one conferences with the instructor to provide support and encouragement for maximum learning. Every section of English 0802, 0812, and 0902 is focused on a complex theme that is explored from multiple perspectives. Students must complete three major writing assignments that are revised and submitted in an end-of-semester final portfolio, and each assignment goes through a peer review and revision process before the portfolio is complete. Students are also asked to reflect upon their own progress and assess their work throughout the semester. Portfolios are reviewed through our Teaching Circle process in which trained instructors agree upon grades for student portfolios every semester.
