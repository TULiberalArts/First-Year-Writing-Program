## English 0701-Introduction to Academic Discourse

[English 0701](http://bulletin.temple.edu/courses/eng/) focuses on writing within a single theme and disciplinary approach. Students’ final portfolios include four sequenced assignments, journal entries, and peer critiques. One typical syllabus guides students through a semester-long series of readings and writing assignments about gender. Revision is emphasized. English 0701 is, in principle, a course which requires multiple drafts of papers from students, and works on building critical reading and writing skills. The focus of the course is to prepare students for success in the kinds of academic reading and writing they will be asked to do in the University.

We wish to invite students to become members of the academic community (rather than its audience or object).  Developing critical reading and writing skills, as well as showing students the importance of accuracy and context when using textual evidence in their own papers, are the key aims of the course.

By the end of the semester, English 0701 students must demonstrate ability to: organize ideas in a coherent manner; connect multiple texts through an issue or an idea; draw points out of a text; and write a reasonably error-free paper. That is, error should not intrude upon the intended meaning or fall outside the parameters of acceptable first-year writing.

### In English 0701, students:

- Learn to process college-level texts, including the development of contextual understanding.
- Read, discuss, and sometimes cite the work of their fellow students.
- Become familiar with academic genres.
- Learn to write papers that are reasonably error-free by concentrating on problems in grammar, mechanics, and usage.
- Do multiple revisions of their papers.
- Incorporate previous work into new assignments.

## English 0711 & 0812- Equivalent courses for ESL Learners

[English 0711](http://bulletin.temple.edu/courses/eng/) and [English 0812](http://bulletin.temple.edu/courses/eng/) are four-credit courses designed to accommodate the needs of the ESL learner. The guidelines for English 0701 and English 0802 are followed in these courses, and the courses carry equivalent credit and equivalent weight in meeting the needs of the core curriculum. As the basis for reading and writing in the ESL writing classroom we look at cross-cultural implications of what it means to do academic work and to share historical and cultural knowledge. Oral participation is encouraged as a way of promoting fluency and enhancing comfort with participation in American academic settings. Classes are smaller than in English 0711 and 0812. Additionally, teachers spend extended time in tutorial conferences. The new syllabus for English 0812 focuses on international issues and uses a book that examines elements of the United States’ relationship with the world from inside and outside the country.

### In English 0711, students:

- Learn to process college-level texts, including the development of contextual understanding.
- Read, discuss, and sometimes cite the work of their fellow students.
- Become familiar with academic genres.
- Learn to write papers that are reasonably error-free by concentrating on problems in grammar, mechanics, and usage.
- Do multiple revisions of their papers.
- Incorporate previous work into new assignments.

### In English 0812, students:  

- Produce papers that represent separate efforts with fewer revisions than in English 0711.
- Establish and support arguments according to the standards of academic discourse.
- Engage complex texts using critical reading skills.
- Possess skills in grammar, mechanics, and usage appropriate to college writing.

## English 0802- Analytical Reading and Writing

[English 0802](http://bulletin.temple.edu/courses/eng/) is a four-credit course that requires students to explore a single theme from the point of view of more than one discipline. Students spend the early part of the semester learning to define terms and articulate specific positions using evidence to support their claims. By semester’s end, English 0802 students should demonstrate both fluency and competence with Standard English in their finished papers, and they should be able to recognize the shortcomings of their earlier drafts. Most importantly, the papers should show the writer’s ability to take a position and order an argument to support that position. Having students critique each other’s writing enlarges the audience for the writer, fosters students learning from each other, and provides opportunities for critical reading in a venue other than assigned readings. This course also emphasizes research, and the evaluation of source materials from the very first assignment.

All classes will visit the library for research workshops with librarians twice in the course of the semester.

** This course addresses the following competencies:**
### Critical Reading and Thinking

Students can read for the purposes of careful analysis and critique, evaluate both the evidence and reasoning in an academic text, and see relationships (explicit and implicit) between and among multiple texts; they can raise meaningful questions, compare ideas, and extract underlying assumptions.

### Self-reflection
- Students are able to reflect, seriously and critically, on their own writing processes as well as their written work.

### Rhetorical Strategies

In academic writing, students can:
- Define key terms for specific purposes.
- Summarize the ideas and arguments of others.
- Make meaningful comparisons between ideas.
- Analyze and respond to the needs of a specific task/audience.

### Argumentation
- Students can take a position, marshal and organize relevant evidence, and respond to opposing views.

### Revision:
- Students can substantively revise earlier written work.

### Correctness:
- In their finished papers, students demonstrate a reasonable degree of both fluency and competence with Standard English, and ESL students should demonstrate marked improvement in these areas. All students should be able to effectively edit their own work.
