- [The English 0802/0812/0902 Library Course Guide](http://guides.temple.edu/english802): Our librarians have put together a course guide for all students in English 0802 and beyond. It contains links and information about conducting academic research at Temple at all levels, and it is especially helpful in the context of your First Year Writing class. 

- [The Writing Center](http://www.temple.edu/writingctr/): The Writing Center offers individual writing support for all students at no extra cost. You can make appointments or walk in to see writing tutors to discuss their writing assignments at any stage of the writing process. Tutors for students whose first language is not English and a Conversation Partners program are also available by request. 

- [Center for Learning and Student Success](http://www.temple.edu/class/): The CLASS offers a range of academic support programs for Temple students at no extra cost. Programs include individualized tutoring, exam review sessions, and academic coaching. 

- [Disability Resources and Services](http://disabilityresources.temple.edu/): The DRS provides support for students who have documented learning differences or accommodation needs. We strongly urge all students who may need support to contact DRS early in their college careers. 

- [The CARE Team](http://careteam.temple.edu/): The CARE Team is a group of faculty and administrators who take referrals from the Temple community pertaining to students of concern. It collects information and finds strategies to support and address the situation.
