English 0701 and English 0802 and the ESL equivalents form a year-long sequence designed to introduce students to academic discourse. Entering first-year students are either placed into the 0701/0802 sequence, placed only in 0802, or exempted from first-year writing courses entirely.

Placement into First Year Writing courses is determined by Institutional Research and Assessment. Information on English placement can be found on the [Online Placement Assessments/NSQ Information page](https://atlas.ocis.temple.edu/MarcPlmts/Splash.html). Questions about placement can be directed to placements@temple.edu or 215-204-8611.
