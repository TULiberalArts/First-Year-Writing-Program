English 0701 and English 0802 and the ESL equivalents form a year-long sequence designed to introduce students to academic discourse. Entering first-year students are either placed into the 0701/0802 sequence, placed only in 0802, or exempted from first-year writing courses entirely.

Placement into First Year Writing courses is determined by Institutional Research and Assessment. Information on English placement can be found here. Questions about placement can be directed to [placements@temple.edu](placements@temple.edu) or [215-204-8611](tel:2152048611).
