If you enjoyed your First Year Writing courses, you might enjoy taking other courses in English. Check out the undergraduate page on the [English Department website](http://www.cla.temple.edu/english/undergraduate/) which includes course offerings and major/minor requirements. Students who major or minor in English go on to careers in university and secondary teaching, law, library and information science, editing and publishing, media and the arts, and non-profit organizations. Strong writers are often highly prized on the job market. Many First Year Writing professors also teach creative writing, literature, and professional writing, and we would love to see you in our other courses!
